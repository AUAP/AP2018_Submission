You click ‘Start game’. You spawn in the hallway. There are four doors in total, but two of them are locked,
these being the main exit and one other door marked “Circuit Room.” You know that the key to the main exit is
in the Circuit Room, so you must find the code to open the door

The doors to the “Radiator Room” and the “Storage Room” are both open. 


In the “Radiator Room” a riddle is written on the wall. 

“Reaching stiffly for the sky, I bare my fingers when it's cold. In warmth I wear an emerald glove and in between I dress in gold.” (The answer is tree)


In the “Storage Room” there are letters with corresponding numbers on the wall. 

N=0
B=1
A=2
T=3
R=4
S=5
E=6
O=7
I=8
G=9

So, the code is 3466 (TREE).

There is also a locked chest on the floor. 
Corresponding the right numbers to the right letters gives you a code that opens the door into the “Circuit Room.” 

The key fits the lock for the chest in the “Radiator Room”. In that chest is a keycard, which makes the main door open. 

You won



So, this is my checklist.
Need to have: Controls “Puzzles” Narrative
Nice to have: Soundtrack Story Main Menu Hover Text on doors Scoreboard Timer Sound Effects Highscore and Clickcount Easter Eggs
What I wanted was a button next to 'Play game' that is called 'FAQ' or something like that where I can insert some text

So I think the important things that need to be there are the following.

//1) The riddles, keypad and objects need to work.

//2) When there's a game over, there needs to be a possibility of going back to the main menu.

//3) On the main menu, there needs to be a "How to play" (including tutorial + extra info), which I will fill out when
the "template" is ready.

//4) Some hover text on doors to show which room it is when mouse is hovered over it

//5) Background picture on main menu (behind the buttons)

//6) Some sound effects when opening doors, opening chests, etc..
