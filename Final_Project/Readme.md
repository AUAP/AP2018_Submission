# Final Project Brief for Aesthetic Programming 2018

## Description:

The course introduces computer coding as an aesthetic, expressive, creative and critical endeavour beyond its functional application. It explores coding as a practice of reading, writing and building, as well as thinking with and in the world, and understanding the complex computational procedures that underwrite our experiences and realities in digital culture. Through coding practice, students are able to contextualize, conceptualize, articulate, design, build, write and run a piece of software. 

By drawing upon different theoretical texts from the course Aesthetic Programming and Software Studies, your group is required to conceptualize, design, implement and articulate a computational artifact that explore one, or more, of the weekly classes' theme, expressing the aesthetic of code/computational structure/computational culture. The idea should be built/reflect centrally upon any one of the assigned/suggested articles in Software Studies/Aesthetic Programming class but you are encouraged to have more than one references to support your idea. In this way, your work should demonstrate the ability to integrate practical skills and theoretical understandings to articulate and develop computational artifacts, examining the aesthetic, cultural, social and political aspects of software.  

To begin with, there are few tips may help you to come up with a project idea: 

1/ You may take a look again on the themes that we have used in our weekly classes for inspiration.  

-	Coding Practice / Open Soure Culture
-	Code and Fun
-	Code and Temporality
-	Code and Data Capture
-	Code and Object Orientation
-	Code and Generativity
-	Code and Language
-	Code and Queries
- Code and Algorithms

2/ Take a look again on all the mini exercises and all the questions that were set. Is there any one that you want to explore further?

3/ Is there any assigned text (from both Software Studies and Aesthetic Programming) that you are especially connected with and you want to explore in a deeper way? (Do you particularly/partially agree or disagree on some of the points in the selected article? Why?)

4/ Is there any particular technical area that you want to explore and employ in this project? 

5/ Take a look at previous students’ work: https://vimeo.com/groups/382805 

## Deliverable:

1/ **RUNME:**  A piece of software written in p5.js (or a combination of HTML/CSS/JS/P5/node.js).
* Remember to include all external libraries and data such as images, font, text file, sound etc. Furthermore, if you have borrowed other sample code, please **cite** your sources in the code comments. 

2/ **README:** A single word document within 6 pages (max characters: 2400 x 6) which has to be properly written academically (exclude images, references and notes). The README document will be used as a base for oral exam.

The document should include a **title**, **a screen shot**, **a flow chart**, **a link to your video documentation/your browser work**, **links to related projects** (if there is any). Please export to a PDF and upload the file (see below #3).

Regarding the README as a synopsis, it should address at least the following questions:
-	What is your software about (short description: what is it, how does it work and what do you want to explore)?
-	How has your work addressed at least one of the themes? Can you reflect about how has your work expressed the aesthetic of code/computational structure/computational culture? (You need to refer explicitly to any one of the assigned articles)
-	Open question: How do you see the project as a critical work in itself?

3/ **Submission via Github:** 
- Submission channel: https://github.com/AUAP/AP2018_Submission
- Create a group folder under the existing one-“Final_Project” e.g Group1, Group2 …
- For draft submission: create a draft folder under your group folder
- For final project submission: create a final folder under your group folder, then put all the RUNME and README (pdf) files inside the final folder.

## Presentation: 

Conduct a presentation within 10 mins with a software demo, articulating your work in both conceptual and technical levels. The presentation will follow by a short Q & A session (within 5 mins). 

* Be selective of your presentation items; present those you think are key to the class
* Make sure you have tested your program in a classroom setting, such as projector, Internet connection, sound, slide, resolution etc. 
* Our internal examiner Marie Louise Juul Søndergaard will be there too.
