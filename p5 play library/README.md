Since we are introducing and show-casing the p5.play library and wasn't given a specific topic to investigate, we are posting our program for the presentation here: 
- We will show how to download and install the p5.play library.
- We will go over the sprite class and how it can be useful, as well as how to navigate the site where the p5.play references and examples are showcased. 
- We will go over some of the more important syntax and functions. Since we don't have that much time we can't possibly make it through everything, so we've picked a few and then there is room for questions. 
- We will show a piece of coding made using largely p5.play, as well as make good use of the examples on the site to show how the library is best utilized. We do it like this because we don't know what the rest of the class might want to know more about, so being able to quickly find an example on the website is a simple solution. 


- Note: You can change most any code that are in the example coding for p5.play, meaning that we will add and remove certain features to showcase what they can and cannot do.
